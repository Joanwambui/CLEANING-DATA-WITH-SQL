# CLEANING-DATA-WITH-SQL
When using data, most people agree that your insights and analysis are only as good as the data you are using. Essentially, garbage data in is garbage analysis out. Data cleaning, also referred to as data cleansing and data scrubbing, is one of the most important steps for your organization if you want to create a culture around quality data decision-making.
Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset. But it is crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process so you know you are doing it the right way every time.
For this project we had a few columns that needed to be separated in the case of addresses.We also removed all the duplicated values.Understanding our dataset was crucial for us to be able to fill in some of the Null values in respective columns as would be illustrated in the code.
